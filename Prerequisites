1. Terraform

ðŸ‘‰ Version: Install the latest stable version of Terraform.
ðŸ‘‰ Installation Guide:
ðŸ‘‰ For Linux: Use package managers like apt or yum.
ðŸ‘‰ For macOS: Use brew install terraform.
ðŸ‘‰ For Windows: Download the binary and add it to your PATH.

2. AWS Account

ðŸ‘‰ Access to AWS: Create an AWS account if you don't have one.
ðŸ‘‰ IAM User: Set up an IAM user with programmatic access, with AdministratorAccess or necessary policies for the resources you'll manage.
ðŸ‘‰ AWS CLI: Install and configure the AWS CLI with the IAM user credentials:

aws configure

3. AWS Access Keys

ðŸ‘‰ You need AWS access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) for Terraform to interact with AWS services.
ðŸ‘‰ Store them in environment variables or a credential file:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key

4. Code Repository (Git)

ðŸ‘‰ Use a Git platform (like GitHub or GitLab) to store and version your Terraform modules.
ðŸ‘‰ Git CLI: Make sure Git is installed for version control and repository management

git --version

5. Text Editor or IDE

ðŸ‘‰ Use an editor like VSCode or JetBrains IDE for writing your Terraform code.
ðŸ‘‰ Install the Terraform extension for syntax highlighting and linting.

6. Terraform State Storage

ðŸ‘‰ Use a remote backend for storing your Terraform state (e.g., AWS S3 bucket with DynamoDB for state locking).

Create an S3 bucket:
aws s3 mb s3://your-terraform-state-bucket

ðŸ‘‰ Set up a DynamoDB table for state locking:
ðŸ‘‰ aws dynamodb create-table --table-name your-tf-lock-table --attribute-definitions At

7. Terraform Cloud/Enterprise (Optional)

ðŸ‘‰ If you want collaboration and workspace management features, set up Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise.

8. Automation Tool

ðŸ‘‰ Choose a CI/CD tool for automating your Terraform module deployment (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or AWS CodePipeline).

9. Terraform Linter (Optional)

ðŸ‘‰ Install a linter like tflint to check for syntax errors and best practices.

10. Access to Open-Source Terraform Modules (Optional)

ðŸ‘‰ Familiarize yourself with existing modules from the Terraform Registry, which can speed up development.
